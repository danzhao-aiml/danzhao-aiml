On the one hand, I am an applied AI research scientist, focusing on several key areas, including but not limited to: efficient AI and learning, energy-efficient computing + supercomputing/HPC, AI agents, and AI for science. 

In a past life, I was an economist and data scientist focusing on causal inference and behavioral economics. 

Some of my work on energy-efficient AI and datacenters as well as AI agents has been covered internationally in media, interviews, podcasts, etc. as well as used extensively by places like the US Department of Energy, VCs, large tech companies, etc.

Having worked in policy, international trade, finance, big tech, quantum computing, social media, gaming/entertainment, healthcare/biotech, drug discovery, and more, I try to take an interdisciplinary approach in my research, applied work, and leadership style. 

Though much of my work has been more applied--i.e., designing, building, and scaling in-house systems, models, and algorithms--I've also published in leading machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML), engineering and distributed computing venues like IEEE and ACM, as well as economic journals like Empirical Economics, and more. 

Some other parts of my work experience have also involved biz ops, biz dev, product, etc. I've also had the honor of advising some really cool start-ups and mentoring some very bright students.

With extensive experience as an individual contributor and team lead, as well as building/cultivating teams from the ground up, I have made contributions to ML‑powered systems that are still in use today from models/algorithms powering pricing engines to efficiently guiding deep learning training jobs, etc.

I'm still learning as I go along.
