Hey, my name is **Dan Zhao**, and I wear multiple hats (for better or worse).

On the one hand, I’m an **applied AI research scientist** focused on several key areas, including but not limited to:
- Efficient AI and learning  
- Energy-efficient computing and supercomputing/HPC  
- AI agents  
- AI for science  

In a past life, I was an economist and data scientist working on causal inference and behavioral economics.

Some of my work on energy-efficient AI, datacenters, and AI agents has been featured internationally in media, interviews, and podcasts. It’s also been applied by organizations such as the U.S. Department of Energy, venture capital firms, and major tech companies.

Having worked across policy, international trade, finance, big tech, quantum computing, social media, gaming and entertainment, healthcare and biotech, and drug discovery, I try to bring an interdisciplinary perspective to my research, applied work, and leadership style.

Though much of my work has been applied—designing, building, and scaling in-house systems, models, and algorithms—I’ve also published in leading machine learning venues like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML, as well as in engineering (IEEE, ACM) and economic journals (Empirical Economics), among others.

Some other parts of my experience have involved business operations, biz dev, and product strategy. I’ve also had the privilege of advising startups and mentoring bright students.

With extensive experience as both an individual contributor and a team lead, as well as building and cultivating teams from the ground up, I’ve made contributions to ML-powered systems that are still in production today—from models and algorithms driving pricing engines to methods that efficiently guide deep learning training jobs.

I’m still learning as I go along.
